## Answers
- What is an ad click aggregator?
An ad click aggregator is a system that logs user clicks on ads, tracks these interactions, and provides metrics to advertisers about the effectiveness of their ads over various time periods.

- What are the functional requirements for an ad click aggregator?
The primary functional requirements are to log ad clicks, ensure users are redirected to the ad's website after clicking, and provide advertisers with metrics such as the number of clicks and the time periods over which they occurred.

- What are the non-functional requirements for an ad click aggregator?
Non-functional requirements include high data integrity to avoid losing clicks, real-time data processing for immediate analytics, fault tolerance to ensure system reliability, and fast response times, ideally less than one second.

- How do you handle the data flow for an ad click aggregator?
Outline a linear list of steps to transform raw click data into meaningful metrics. This includes defining how clicks are logged, processed, and stored, and how metrics are generated and queried.

- What is the high-level design for an ad click aggregator?
The high-level design includes components such as a click processor to log clicks, a redirect mechanism to send users to the ad's website, and a query service to retrieve and display click metrics to advertisers.

- How do you design a system to redirect users to the ad's website after a click?
You can use a redirect URL that navigates users directly to the ad's website or make them first come to your server, which then responds with the redirect URL. The latter gives more control and ensures click logging.

- How do you query click metrics efficiently?
Implement a query service that constructs queries to a click database. Consider using OLAP databases for complex queries and aggregations over large datasets to meet performance requirements.

- What are the challenges with querying click metrics over large time windows?
Handling large volumes of click data can be slow, especially when querying across extended time periods. This requires efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms to maintain performance.

- How can you scale an ad click aggregator to handle 10,000 clicks per second?
Scale the click processor and OLAP databases horizontally. Use sharding to distribute the load across multiple servers and ensure each server handles a manageable portion of the data.

- What is the role of a query service in an ad click aggregator?
The query service allows advertisers to retrieve metrics by constructing and executing queries on the click database. It provides a structured way to access and analyze click data.

- What database options are suitable for storing click data?
Suitable options include Cassandra, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, and OLAP databases. The choice depends on the specific requirements for data volume, query complexity, and performance.

- How do you ensure fault tolerance and high data integrity in the system?
Implement fault-tolerant mechanisms such as data replication and backups. Use periodic reconciliation jobs to verify data accuracy and ensure no clicks are lost or duplicated.

- What is the aggregation window in data processing, and why is it important?
The aggregation window is the period during which data is grouped for processing. It determines how frequently data is aggregated and affects the timeliness and accuracy of the metrics.

- How do you use Cron jobs to manage periodic data processing?
Use Cron jobs to schedule regular tasks, such as triggering data processing jobs (e.g., with Spark) at fixed intervals. This ensures that data is processed consistently and in a timely manner.

- What is OLAP, and why is it useful for an ad click aggregator?
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) databases are optimized for complex queries and aggregations, making them suitable for analyzing large volumes of click data and generating detailed metrics.

- How do you handle read and write path separation for better performance and fault isolation?
Separate the read and write paths to ensure that issues in one path do not affect the other. This allows the system to continue logging clicks even if the query service experiences issues.

- What is periodic reconciliation, and why is it necessary for data integrity?
Periodic reconciliation involves running jobs to verify and correct data discrepancies. This ensures the accuracy of click metrics and addresses any inconsistencies that may arise during real-time processing.

- What are idempotent operations, and why are they important in system design?
Idempotent operations produce the same result even when applied multiple times. This is crucial for ensuring consistent data processing and preventing duplicate entries, especially in distributed systems.

- How do you generate and verify unique impression IDs for ad clicks?
Generate a unique impression ID on the server when an ad is displayed. Use this ID to track clicks and verify it using a cache (e.g., Redis) to ensure each click is logged only once.

- What role does a cache (e.g., Redis) play in verifying impression IDs?
A cache stores the impression IDs temporarily to quickly verify incoming clicks and prevent duplicates. This enhances the system's efficiency and ensures data integrity.

- How do you sign impression IDs to ensure data integrity?
Use a private key to sign impression IDs when generating them. Upon receiving a click, verify the signature to ensure the ID is valid and was generated by your server.
